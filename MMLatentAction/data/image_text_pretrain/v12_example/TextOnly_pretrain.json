        "content": "The new rules are very wide-reaching, often completely different than the superseded rules that existed for years, and portions are incredibly complex. Additional guidance in the form of Treasury Regulations is expected.\nThe changes do not entirely move the U.S. out of the \"worldwide income\" taxation regime and into the \"territorial\" regime, but they move us much closer in that direction.\nThis article is written with the assumption that its readers have some level of familiarity with U.S. taxation of international operations, although it will provide some background for those less familiar. Some aspects of international taxation have not been changed, and this article is not intended to provide an overview of the system. Instead, it will focus on some of the most widely-relevant areas changed by the TCJA.\nOne can only understand U.S. taxation of international operations by distinguishing between two competing systems \u2013 (1) worldwide taxation and (2) territorial taxation \u2013 and by understanding the concept and historical use of Controlled Foreign Corporations.\nHistorically, U.S.-based individuals and corporations have been required to report and pay U.S. income taxes on their worldwide income. This results in some income being taxed both by a foreign country and by the U.S. Use of a \"foreign tax credit\" allows U.S. companies to reduce their U.S. taxes by the amount of taxes paid to foreign countries on that same income. While subject to a number of limitations, this regime attempts to avoid double-taxation that otherwise would unfairly burden U.S. taxpayers.\nUnlike the U.S., nearly every other industrialized country in the world uses a territorial system, where the country only taxes the income that is earned within its borders.\nThe concept of Controlled Foreign Corporations is pervasive under both old and new law, and their treatment differs from other types of taxpayers.\nWorldwide taxation generally put U.S.-based companies at a disadvantage compared to foreign-based entities. All income (including overseas income) was taxed by the U.S., and the complex math behind the foreign tax credit did not always allow it to mitigate double taxation. Add to this the fact that the U.S. tax rates have been higher than nearly any other industrialized country's corporate rate, and you had a system that right out of the gate placed U.S.-based multinational companies at a huge disadvantage when competing with overseas competitors. They were faced with a higher tax applied to a broader base than their competitors, and to achieve the same level of after-tax profit, they had to be more efficient (which is difficult when U.S. labor costs are relatively high), or price their products higher, which could drive buyers to their competitors' products.\nTo legally circumvent worldwide taxation and attain equal footing with non-U.S. based competitors, many U.S. taxpayers formed foreign subsidiaries, or even underwent \"corporate inversions,\" whereby the U.S. company or its subsidiary took the form of a CFC. A CFC is simply a corporation that is not based in the U.S., but is owned/controlled by a U.S. taxpayer (often, but not necessarily, another corporation). Because CFCs are based in other countries rather than the U.S., they were not subject to the worldwide taxation regime. They may be subject to their foreign host country's taxation, but their income became subject to U.S. taxation only when repatriated (brought back into the U.S., often via dividends paid to its U.S. owner).\nThe historical CFC can be best viewed as a legal tax-deferral structure. As long as the money stayed out of the U.S., the U.S. taxation of that company's earnings was deferred. Note that foreign entities that are disregarded as separate from their owners (known as \"check the box entities\"), as well as flow-through entities, are not CFCs. They, instead, generally remain subject to the worldwide income regime.\nFor starters, the TCJA reduces the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% - much closer to the average corporate rate assessed by other countries.\nIt also completely upends CFC's deferral features \u2013 in two ways. First, a tax of either 15.5% (for liquid assets) or 8% (for non-liquid assets) will be due on PAST cumulative, deferred earnings. This one-time tax will be payable over an 8-year period, with the first payment, representing 8% of the total tax, due for most calendar year taxpayers by April 15, 2018.\nObservation: Although this deadline coincides with the filing deadline of many taxpayers' 2017 tax returns, an extension of time to file the tax return does not extend the time to make this payment. The computations necessary to determine the tax may be very complex and time-consuming.\nThe second way the TCJA upends CFC's deferral features is by imposing an annual tax on gross CFC income that exceeds a certain rate of return.\nIt also provides an incentive, though, in the form of a reduced tax rate on a portion of income, for taxpayers who earn foreign income derived from the use of U.S.-based intangibles.\nThese, and many other features of the Act are discussed in more detail below.\nThe TCJA provides a one-time transitional tax on a U.S. 10%-or-more shareholder's pro rata share of the foreign corporation's post-1986 tax-deferred earnings. This is accomplished as somewhat of a deemed dividend, in that it occurs whether or not any funds are transferred. One of two tax rates will be applied to the earnings: 15.5% (in the case of accumulated earnings held in cash, cash equivalents or certain other short-term assets) or 8% (in the case of accumulated earnings invested in illiquid assets, like property, plant and equipment). The foreign corporation's post-1986 tax-deferred earnings subject to tax is the greater of the earnings as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017. It excludes earnings and profits that were accumulated by a foreign company prior to attaining its status as a specified foreign corporation, but allows post-1986 accumulated earnings deficits of any foreign corporations to offset tax-deferred earnings of other foreign corporations (netting generally may be used among all affiliated group members).\nThe U.S. shareholder may elect to pay the transitional tax over a period of up to eight years. The first payment is due for most filers by April 15, 2018 for calendar year U.S. taxpayers. At that time, and each of the next four years, 8% of the tax is due. In years five, six and seven, respectively, the remaining 15%, 20%, and 25% of the tax is due.\nThe TCJA allows shareholders of S corporations that in turn own specified foreign corporations to defer the toll charge until a \"termination event\" occurs, including a sale of the S corporation stock, cessation of status as an S corporation, or a liquidation of the S corporation.\nThe TCJA exempts 100% of the foreign-source portion of dividends received by a U.S. corporation from a foreign corporation (other than a Passive Foreign Investment Corporation (PFIC) that is not also a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC)) in which the U.S. corporation owns at least a 10% stake. It does not allow the same exemption to U.S. individual shareholders; the exemption applies only to C corporations. The effective date is generally for distributions made after December 31, 2017. Some additional specifics are noted below.\nThe exemption applies only if the stock of the foreign corporation has been held for more than one year.\nNo foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any portion of a distribution that is also exempt under this provision (no double-dipping!).\nA special rule applies to the sale of foreign corporations. The TCJA applies the dividend exemption to gain on the sale of foreign stock only to the extent of its earnings and profits (E&P), and clarifies that the dividend exemption will apply on the gain from the sale of lower tier CFCs to the extent of that CFC's E&P. Only for determining loss on the sale of stock of a 10% owned foreign corporation, a U.S. parent would reduce its basis in the stock of the foreign corporation by an amount equal to the exempt dividend it received from that foreign corporation.\nThe TCJA allows an exemption for a U.S. corporation's distributive share of a dividend received by a partnership in which the U.S. corporation is a partner if the dividend would have been eligible for the exemption had the U.S. corporation directly owned stock in the foreign corporation.\nAnti-base erosion rules, as the name suggests, refer to an attempt to prevent the U.S. tax base from eroding. The TCJA includes some positive and negative encouragement toward this end (a stick and a carrot, if you will), both geared toward taxpayer's utilization of intangible assets. Two predominant provisions stand out from the others: The \"GILTI\" stick that applies to foreign-based entities (CFCs), and the \"FDII\" carrot that applies to U.S.-based taxpayers who earn money overseas.\nThe TCJA imposes a new tax on a U.S. shareholder's aggregate net CFC income that is treated as global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). GILTI is gross income in excess of extraordinary returns derived from tangible depreciable assets, excluding effectively connected income (ECI), subpart F income, high-taxed income, and dividends from related parties. The extraordinary return base is equal to 10% of the CFCs' aggregate adjusted basis in depreciable tangible property. Under these rules, only 80% of the foreign taxes paid on the income will be allowed as a foreign tax credit. All CFCs are aggregated for purposes of the computation. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026 the highest effective tax rate on GILTI is 10.5%. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 the effective tax rate on GILTI is 13.125%.\nObservation: The one-time toll charge described earlier is just that (one-time). However, this portion of the anti-erosion rules will cause CFCs that are extraordinarily profitable overseas, or whose overseas profits are derived too heavily from intangible sources, to pay a tax in the U.S. based on the deemed excess. This will discourage companies from stockpiling cash earned from offshore intangible property out of the country. How? This feature will tax excess earnings before they are repatriated, and not allow the dividend exclusion described earlier on such income.\nForeign derived intangible income (\"FDII\") is income derived by U.S. companies in connection with property sold, leased, or licensed to, and services provided to, foreign persons. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, FDII is effectively taxed at a lower rate than normally would apply (21% for corporations). Specifically, it allows an effective tax rate of 13.125%. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the effective tax rate on FDII is 16.406%.\nProceeds from sales, leasing, or licensing, and revenue from services provided to a related foreign person are included only if the related foreign person sells the property to an unrelated foreign person, and the taxpayer establishes that the ultimate sale is for foreign use. Income from services provided to related foreign persons is included if the taxpayer establishes that the related person does not perform substantially similar activities for U.S. persons.\nObservation: This provides a tax break for U.S.-based companies that sell or lease property outside of the country. It thereby encourages companies to remain based in the U.S.. It is unclear to what extent this benefit will apply to flow-through entities, which have their own new 20% deduction of flow-through income created by the TCJA. Practitioners expect a flurry of Treasury Regulations to begin materializing that address this and other ambiguities in the new law.\nThe TCJA changes the definition of intangible property to include workforce in place, goodwill and going concern value and \"any similar item,\" the value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of an individual. It also confirms the authority of the Treasury Department to require certain valuation methods.\nThe TCJA establishes a separate foreign tax credit basket for branches, and appears to establish another one for GILTI income (described above). These join the existing baskets of general and passive income, resulting in four baskets. This change reduces a corporation's ability to utilize foreign tax credits generated by one type of activity against income created by another.\nThe TCJA amends the \"source of income\" rules under Sec. 863(b). For property manufactured in the U.S. and sold overseas, this will result in more income \"sourced\" to the U.S. for purposes of the foreign tax credit. This will produce a smaller foreign tax credit, but other portions of the Act will in many cases mitigate this damage.\nIndirect foreign tax credits will be available only for Subpart F income. No credits will be allowed with respect to any dividends associated with exempt dividends. Applicable to C-corporations only, foreign tax credits will be used on a current year basis and will not be allowed to be carried forward or back.\nThe TCJA creates a new base erosion anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\"). It applies only to certain very large companies. Specifically, the BEAT applies to corporations (other than RICs, REITs, or S-corporations) that are subject to U.S. net income tax, and have average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million, and that have made related party deductible payments totaling 3% (2% in the case of banks and certain security dealers) or more of the corporation's total deductions for the year. A corporation subject to the tax generally determines the amount of tax owed under the provision (if any) by adding back to its adjusted taxable income for the year all deductible payments made to a foreign affiliate (\"base erosion payments\") for the year (the \"modified taxable income\"). Base erosion payments do not include cost of goods sold, certain amounts paid with respect to services, and certain qualified derivative payments. The excess of 10% (5% in the case of one taxable year for base erosion payments paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the corporation's modified taxable income over its regular tax liability for the year (net of an adjusted amount of tax credits allowed) is the base erosion minimum tax amount that is owed. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2025 the rate is increased from 10% to 12.5%. The rate for certain banks and security dealers is 1% higher than the rates described above. Premiums related to reinsurance of life and property and casualty contracts are specifically included as base erosion payments.\nTransfers of property from the U.S. to another country generally result in taxable gain. Prior to the TCJA, an exception existed that allowed property used in an active trade or business to avoid this treatment, and instead qualify as a tax-free organization, reorganization, or liquidation. The exception is removed with the passage of TCJA.\nFor purposes of the foreign tax credit, the TCJA provides an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income that may be offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and re-characterized as foreign source.\nThe definition of a U.S. shareholder was changed to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value (as well as voting power) of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. Related to this, U.S. corporations will be deemed to own the foreign stock that is owned by the U.S. corporation's foreign parent for purposes of determining CFC status. The TCJA clarifies that the provision is intended to target transactions that avoid subpart F by \"de-controlling\" a foreign subsidiary so that it is no longer a CFC. So brother/sister foreign corporations owned by a U.S. subsidiary's foreign parent would be a CFC and such U.S. subsidiary U.S. corporate tax filings would require additional information tax reporting.\nObservation: This is relevant to whether or not Form 5471 must be filed (and which portions of this complex form must be completed), the one-time repatriation tax, and GILTI income, and will result in more entities being subject to new requirements via attribution.\nUnder the TCJA, foreign corporations will be considered as CFCs as soon as the ownership requirements are met and the entity is subject to the subpart F and base erosion rules. Under the old rules, an entity was not considered to be a CFC unless held for at least 30 days. The TCJA thus closes a loophole.\nCurrently, Sec. 954 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") allows dividends, interest and royalties received by one CFC from another CFC to qualify as deferred income, rather than immediately taxable income. This feature was a temporary one, set to expire after 2019. The TCJA did not intervene to make this feature permanent. Thus, the rule expires after 2019, and such income will be taxable unless otherwise exempt.\nBoth the House and Senate bill repealed or modified existing Sec. 956 rules, and it was therefore anticipated that the final law would as well. However, the TCJA adopted no such change. Any investments by a CFC into U.S. property, including loans to CFC shareholders and guarantees of U.S. shareholder debt, will continue to trigger subpart F income for such U.S. shareholders.\nObservation: Without this rule, entities might circumvent dividend treatment under the CFC regime by categorizing cash transfers as loans to their parent companies, rather than dividends.\nGain from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest is treated as effectively connected income (\"ECI\"), and, therefore, is subject to U.S. tax, to the extent the partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or business and the foreign partner would have had ECI had the partnership sold all of its assets. There is also a provision that would require the partnership to withhold 10% of the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the partnership interest unless the transferor certifies that the transferor is not a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation.\nA previous version of the Act proposed unfavorable changes to the tax treatment of interest charge domestic international sales corporations (\"IC-DISC\"). Those proposed changes were dropped, however, and the tax treatment of the IC-DISC structure survives.\nObservation: While the treatment survives, the tax rate savings impact of an IC-DISC is somewhat muted as a result of other tax rate changes in the Act. Its benefit for individual taxpayers that receive DISC dividends relates solely to the difference between the 23.8% top tax rate that generally applies to dividend income (including the net investment tax at 3.8%) and the top rate an individual would pay on pass-through income for entity that pays commissions to the IC-DISC. Under the Act, for S-corporation and LLC owners the owners receive a 2.6% decrease in the top rate, and potentially pay tax on only 80% of their S-corporation income. This makes the effective rate differential smaller. So assuming a pass-through owner with a DISC paying tax on operating earnings is subject to a top tax rate of 29.6% (37% x 80%), this would still result of permanent tax rate savings of 5.8% when compared to the 23.8% top dividend tax rate on DISC dividends. So if the volume of foreign sales is there, IC DISC's still makes sense.\nIt should be apparent that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes significant new burdens on both U.S. and foreign taxpayers. International taxation was complex before these changes, and the new concepts do not simplify it at all. We have a new regime \u2013 not the worldwide income structure left behind, or a territorial system sported by many countries, but sort of a pseudo-territorial structure all our own. We most certainly will see voluminous new Treasury Regulations and other guidance to follow.\nOwners of controlled foreign corporations (\"CFCs\") are encouraged to very quickly undertake any necessary computations of accumulated earnings, which may be very time-consuming; and prepare for the first payment of the new repatriation tax that for most taxpayers is due by April 15 of this year.\nIf you would like to discuss these matters further, contact Stuart Lyons, international tax practice lead, or your BNN advisor at 1.800.244.7444."

My life has devolved into getting through today and tomorrow with an eye to how next week is going to fall. It's an improvement. I used to just try to get through each day.\nLast week, though, I got surprised. I woke up early one morning and it was raining - I have always found rain to be incredibly romantic - and I was warm beneath the comforter in my big, queen sized bed when I turned my head and saw that empty spot next to me. Suddenly, I missed him. I missed him and I wanted to be warm in his arms and listen to the rain and his breathing and know I was loved.\nFoolish, I know. I was never really loved the way I thought I was by him. If I were, he wouldn't have moved on, even before we were done.\nEven before I knew we were done.\nAnd he's got a new companion and new life and beautiful new house they bought together with state-of-the art everything while I try to figure out how to repair a toilet flapper and can't fix my lawn mower and my oven doesn't work anymore.\nIt's easy, so easy to feel like I got the short end of the stick.\nEven if they don't end up making it work, he's still got a whole playing field out there waiting for him. He's good-looking, with just enough distinguished gray in his hair. He's fit. He's got a great job as an executive and he can date down twenty years without getting much of a reaction out of anyone.\nMe? Well, a late-fortysomething, not-quite-at-my-dating-weight single Mom with two kids still at home doesn't have quite the same options. And if I tell someone I'm someday-dating that I'm heavily in debt to my underwater mortgage, I have primary physical custody of my kids and oh, by the way, my son has autism - well, let's just say my prospects will be even more less-than-stellar.\nYeah, I got the raw deal. Taken to the cleaners. Treated like a doormat. I deserve to feel shafted. I try not to wallow in it too much or label myself a victim, because that's counter-productive and a total waste of time. It is what it is, and I got what I got and now it's up to me to move forward.\nSome women are immobilized by the grief that comes with this kind of a wound. Some retreat into bitterness and anger and vengeance. Don't paint me with a saintly brush - I've inhabited all those worlds for short visits, but I haven't felt like staying and building a house on any of them. The thing that's seen me through the worst of this (other than my children, of course) is this one simple truth.\nI haven't lost as much as he has. Not really.\nI lost someone who didn't really love me as much as I thought he did. He, on the other hand, lost someone who loved him very much, and with everything she had. I am capable of having and sustaining such a love.\nIt's not much to cling to some days.\nBut some days, it feels like a victory flag set atop the mountain of my new truth.\nEllie- I so get this. You put your heart and soul into a man and he betrays that love, breaks your heart and then leaves you holding the peices of the life you built with him. The scars never really heal. But remember this - the love that you gave him that he didin't deserve- its not wasted, love never is. The universe owes you that love and sometime, somewhere, someone will give it back to you."

Here are the latest women in film industry who have it all to make it to having their names on the Walk of Fame. Here is a fastidious pick of four girls out of Vanity Fair's 24.\nProvenance: North Hollywood, California.\nYou first glimpsed her as \u2026 Jodie Foster's doppelg\u00e4nger daughter in Panic Room (2002). \"[Director] David Fincher does a lot of takes,\" Stewart says:\nThere was this one scene we must have done, like, 80 times. I didn't know that it wasn't the norm. Now I wouldn't be as chill with it \u2026 \"\nBecause now she's a prolific industry veteran, with four films due out this year. Namely, In the Land of Women, The Messengers, The Cake Eaters (the directorial debut of Mary Stuart Masterson, with Stewart in the lead role), and Sean Penn's Into the Wild, based on the Jon Krakauer book. But is this the life for her? Not necessarily:\nI want to go to college for literature. I want to be a writer. I mean, I love what I do, but it's not all I want to do\u2014be a professional liar for the rest of my life.\"\nStill, Kristen's no brooder: \"I love big-band music, and I'm taking swing classes now. I can't wait till I'm going to be able to be tossed up in the air.\"\nProvenance: London.\nYou know her as \u2026 the cold-eyed young Brit who stole The Devil Wears Prada, delivering the performance most comically evocative of what editorial assistants are really like at \u2026 oh, certain publishing companies we've heard of. \"I kind of knew that girl\u2014she's a total impersonation of various people whom I would find personally excruciating,\" says Blunt, who is also a 2007 Golden Globe winner for her performance in the BBC drama Gideon's Daughter.\nBut what I liked about that character was that there was the opportunity to glimpse something beyond sarcasm. There's a vulnerability that's transparent to me, when someone defines herself just by having an association with someone else.\"\nAnd you'll know her better still after you see her this year in \u2026 Wind Chill, a thriller produced by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh (\"I literally went from wearing Manolos to huge snow boots covered in blood and mud\"); The Great Buck Howard, with John Malkovich, Tom Hanks, and Colin Hanks; Dan in Real Life, in which she gets to \"have a dance-off\" with Steve Carell; and The Jane Austen Book Club, an ensemble piece in which Blunt plays \"a total nerd\u2014a different part for me, because I often play the fast-talking, manipulative sort of character.\" Extraordinary, considering that \u2026\nI had a really bad stutter as a child. It never occurred to me that I would want to be on the stage, because I couldn't even bloody talk. My parents tried everything: I had speech therapy, I had [recordings of] dolphins squeaking at me at night to try and relax me, cranial osteopathy, everything you could do. And then I had a rather wonderful teacher who encouraged me to do the class play when I was about 12. I think he had the faith in me that I'd rise to the occasion. Or maybe he just had the smarts to say, 'Why don't you be someone else?'\"\nAnd now she's smooth-talked her way into a relationship with swingin' singer Michael Bubl\u00e9: \"It's wonderful. I love him. We met at some awards ceremony and I was a bit of a fan and I told him, and he liked compliments, obviously.\"\nProvenance: Rockland County, New York.\nCurrently serving humankind as \u2026 Claire, \"the Cheerleader,\" on NBC's breakout hit Heroes. \"[The show] just sort of plopped in my lap,\" Panettiere says:\nI was walking out of a general meeting with NBC, and they were like, 'Oh, hey, by the way, read this'\u2014this script with a cockroach running across the front of it. And I read it, and it was amazing.\"\nLook out, Mandy Moore: Panettiere's debut album, for which she co-wrote most of the songs, comes out this spring.\nMy [day] job is to portray people who are not myself, and this is sort of getting to portray a little bit of me.\" What happens to college plans when you have a hit series at 17? \"I've got 15 alumni from Duke University in my family. I absolutely want to go to college, but I don't know if it's going to work out with this series. [To her mom, Lesley] How long are we on contract? [Mom says, \"I think it's six years.\"] Oh my God, I'll be 23!\"\nAnd finally the hottest pick. She is the one from Mamma Mia!\nProvenance: Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nYou know her\u2026 as the coming-of-age teen in everyone's favorite polygamy-motif'd TV show, Big Love. But you'll see her next as Meryl Streep's daughter in the screen adaptation of Mamma Mia! \"She's the coolest human being ever,\" says Seyfried of her on-camera mom. She didn't treat me like I was younger. She respected me. I couldn't ask for anything better.\" Diablo rising: Next up for Seyfried is Jennifer's Body, the latest project from multi-tattooed Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody.\nI play the nerdy best friend of Jennifer, who becomes a zombie. I'm like the heroine of the movie. I have to try to save the small town we live in.\"\nEva Herzigova & Karl Lagerfeld's calendar\nOrlando Bloom is a new UNICEF Ambassador\n10 most googled celebrities 2011\nCategory: Celebrity News\nPosted to: Amanda Seyfried, Emily Blunt, George Clooney, Hayden Panettiere, Jodie Foster, John Malkovich, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Sean Penn, Tom Hanks\nMadonna Appeared in a Cub Scout Uniform at The GLAAD Awards\t\u00bb\nMadonna appeared in a scout uniform while fighting for gay rights in New York City at the 24th annual Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Awards.\n18-03-2013 | Read Full Article\nCelebrities Tweet About The New Pope\t\u00bb\nWe have two amazing news to comment today, one is about the newly elected pope and the second is - celebrities recent tweets, either about the pope and about their everyday life as well!\n2013 SXSW Film Festival has Launched\t\u00bb\nThe 2013 SXSW Film Conference and Festival has launched in Austin, Texas.\nTop Celebrities Walking with their Kids\t\u00bb\nTop celebrity's kids outside with their children, featuring Naomi Watts, Amy Adams, Salma Hayek and Hugh Jackman and others\nMiranda Kerr's Real Mondays\t\u00bb\nMiranda Kerr's carries her son Flynn on Monday, puts her picture naked on Instagram and jokes about sunglasses.\nRihanna Wears Double Jeans at River Island After Party!\t\u00bb\nRihanna wears double jeans at River Island after party in London!\nJennifer Lawrence's harsh transformations, blonde or brunette?\t\u00bb\nJennifer Laurence's transformations of recent time.

        "content": "#21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J. K. Rowling\nJoin Harry and his friends as they return to Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft for their fifth year.\nShortly before his return to Hogwarts, Harry and Dudley, his big, dumb muggle cousin, face a Dementor attack... right in the middle of Little Whinging! Harry ends up using magic to repel the dementors, but because of that offense\u2014underage magic in the presence of muggles\u2014he is forced to attend a hearing and face possible expulsion from Hogwarts! But just what were dementors doing in Little Whinging if not specifically sent to attack Harry?\nSo begins Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth book in the Harry Potter series. The Order of the Phoenix is actually a secret society of Wizards and Witches founded by Dumbledore, it's members being the same that fought against Voldemort last time. Unfortunately, with Cornelius Fudge and the rest of the Ministry of Magic vehemently denying Voldemort's return, and taking every opportunity they can to slander both Dumbledore and Harry through stories in the Daily Prophet, the Order definitely has their work cut out for them.\nStarting with the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, these books have definitely gotten darker, and in my opinion have stepped outside the realm of children's books while still remaining in the young adult category.\nI didn't like this book quite as much as The Goblet of Fire which seemed to have a lot more going on. Overall, it was still an excellent book as I rated it 8 out of 10; however I just couldn't help comparing it to Goblet of Fire, and in that regard, I didn't feel it quite measured up to that standard.\n(I actually feel the opposite about the movie versions: Goblet left out so much from the book, missing a lot of key points and issues, that I didn't like it that much; while Phoenix was more complete to the book, and perhaps even a bit more flashy than its predecessor.)\nTags: fantasy, paranormal/occult, young adult\n#25 Shakespeare's Counselor: A Lily Bard Mystery b...\n#24 Shakespeare's Trollop: A Lily Bard Mystery by ...\n#23 Dancing Above the Waves by Susan Walerstein\n#22 Fendi, Ferragamo, & Fangs by Julie Kenner, Joh...\nCONTEST - 50 Ways to Hex Your Lover by Linda Wisdom\n#21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J...\n#20 California Demon: The Secret Life of a Demon-H..."

Lawns and gardens can become very leafy at this time of the year. So the question becomes: is this okay and what should we do with these leaves? Here are some pointers.\nCan I move my perennials now (in fall) or should I wait until spring?\nFall is a time for garden renovations. At this time of the year we can readily visualize changes we want to make using the \"data\" that relate to our gardens' dynamics (exposure, soil conditions, plant height, colour combos etc). And whether due to plants growing larger than expected or simply for maintenance purposes it is very common to wonder about moving or dividing perennials in September / early October."

        "content": "My parents immigrated to Israel in 1950 after surviving the concentration camps of World War II. Once in Israel, they moved to a small village near Petah Tikvah where they continued their family tradition of farming. As a child I helped farm the land, milk the cows and worked in the chicken coop. By the time I was in High School I realized that I did not want to be a farmer.\nI excelled in my studies in High School and with the support of my parents I decided to focus on medicine as a career. My dream was to not only be a doctor but to become a researcher as well. I wanted to help people in the best way that I believed I knew how. After my first year in the army I became a student at The Hebrew University's Medical School and remained a part of the faculty to this day.\nMy main field from the beginning was prenatal and postnatal development of children. I focused on the causes of abnormal development. By the time I was in my third year of Medical School, I began studying bone and skeleton development which I continued for a number of years. LaterI focused on the development of the brain, with special emphasis on normal and abnormal development of children. After finishing my degree in medicine, I began my training in Pediatrics in Hadassah Hospital. In the US I trained in clinical Teratology and Developmental Pediatrics, which have been the main areas of my research and clinical work for the last twenty years.\nServing as the Head of the Department of Child Development and Rehabilitation in Israel's Ministry of Health, I continue to be heavily involved in the development of policies for diagnosis and treatment of children with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder). My research in this area focuses on possible prenatal causes of autism: maternal treatment during pregnancy with valproic acid and/or SSRIs or other causes. I also plan to develop experimental models to investigate possible etiologies (causes) of ASD.\n2009: Additional training in pediatric neurology, licensef in \"Pediatric Neurology and Child Development\"\n1987: Visiting professor - Clinical Teratology, Child Development and Pediatric Neurology Dept of Pediatrics, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA.\nAre the body functions of children with Down syndrome related to their participation?\nThe prevalence of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is steadily increasing and is now more than 10 times more common than it was 60 years ago. With that statistic in mind, IMRIC is embarking on new, intensive research in ASD. This research will question whether the maternal use of psychotropic drugs (i.e. anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety, anti-depressives, and other drugs affecting the brain) in pregnancy is associated with Autistic Spectrum Disorders in the offspring."
